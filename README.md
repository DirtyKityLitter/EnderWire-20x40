# EnderWire-20x40
Build for a Switchwire Conversion for Ender 3 with 20x40 Y Extrusion

Special Thanks and recognition to boubounokefalos and clintiepoo on github found here: https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW for the initial files that led to the engineering design of this conversion specifically for the Ender3 in the image below:

All parts labeled “Creality” such as: “Creality_Rear_Y_motor_Mount_Left” are specific to the 20x40 center extrusion. 

Everything else is EnderWire except for the Front and Rear Center Skirts. The front skirt I designed does not allow a screen or controller to be mounted keeping the frame “clean” I use a RaspberryPi running Klipper and have a 7” touchscreen mounted away from the printer itself. Feel free to use the optional front mount if you want a “full switchwire conversion” from boubounokefalos and clintiepoo included in this repository. 

All Parts are designed with shrinkage in mind. If you have any suggestions in terms of part orientation and printing let me know. All parts in pictures printed on a Voron 2.4r with Stealthburner Tool Head running a Voron Revo 4mm High Flow Nozzle using MatterHackers ABS filament.
